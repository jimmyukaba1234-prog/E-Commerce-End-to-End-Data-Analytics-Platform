E-Commerce End-to-End Data Analytics Platform

This repository contains a full end-to-end e-commerce data analytics platform designed to provide deep visibility into customer behavior, operational performance, and revenue drivers. The project addresses a common business challenge: while transactions occur consistently, there is limited clarity on why customers churn, which products and regions drive profit, and where operational inefficiencies impact growth.

The solution is built on large-scale historical e-commerce data spanning multiple domains, including customers (50,500 rows × 24 columns), orders (101,000 rows × 24 columns), products (10,300 rows × 30 columns), and reviews (50,400 rows × 20 columns). A relational database was first designed and populated, after which an automated ETL pipeline was developed to extract, clean, transform, and integrate the data into analytics-ready tables.

Following data preparation, comprehensive exploratory analysis, business intelligence dashboards, and visualizations were created to answer key business questions around customer retention, churn patterns, regional performance, product profitability, fulfillment efficiency, payment failures, and long-term financial trends. Insights reveal a “leaky bucket” retention pattern, declining sales and profit over time, operational bottlenecks in delivery and payments, and a heavy concentration of revenue among a small group of high-value customers.

To move beyond descriptive analytics, predictive models were built for customer churn and customer lifetime value (LTV). The churn model leverages RFM features—especially recency—to identify high-risk customers early, enabling targeted re-engagement strategies. The LTV model highlights how future revenue is driven by a small number of high-value customers with infrequent but high-ticket purchases, supporting smarter prioritization and resource allocation.

The project also includes automated reporting, generating stakeholder-ready PDF reports, and a web application that allows users to interact with insights in real time. Overall, this repository demonstrates a complete analytics lifecycle—from database design and data engineering to modeling, reporting, and deployment—aimed at driving data-informed decision-making, improving retention, and supporting sustainable e-commerce growth.
